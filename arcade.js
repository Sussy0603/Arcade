   differs is which catalog the rows came out of and which folder holds their
   screenshots. Two pages would mean two copies of the stylesheet, two copies
   of this file, and a slow divergence between them that nobody decided on.

   So everything that differs lives in this one table, and a third section
   one day is a row here plus a button in index.html — not a hunt through
   this file for the word "games".

   Today's pick and Surprise me are games-only, and that is the single real

/* ---------------- Today's pick ----------------

   else. No server, no stored state, no editor: every visitor loading the
   page on the same day computes the same answer from the list they already
   fetched, and tomorrow they compute a different one.

   It deals rather than draws. A plain "hash the date, take the winner"
   lottery is one line shorter and wrong in the way people actually notice:
   over 84 games it will put the same game up two days running inside the
   first few months, and a repeat looks broken in a way that a boring pick
   never does. So the whole pool is dealt into a per-cycle order and today
   takes one seat of it — every game is featured exactly once before any game
   is featured twice, and the order is dealt fresh on each pass through.

   Two costs, both stated rather than hidden. The cycle length is the number
   of games, so publishing a new game re-deals the current cycle and can move
   the pick mid-day — a jump nobody is watching for, on the rare day a game
   ships. And a game dealt last in one pass can come up early in the next, so
   the tightest possible repeat is a few days; it can only happen on a cycle
   boundary, which at 84 games is roughly quarterly.

/* What is on screen right now: the whole list, or the part of it a search
   has narrowed it to. Two callers need the same answer — the grid that
   paints it, and Surprise me, which draws from what the visitor can actually
   see rather than from games their search has just ruled out.

   Two fields, matched two different ways, and the difference is the whole
   design of this function.

   The name is matched with includes(), anywhere: "doku" should find "Cozy
   Sudoku", because a half-remembered fragment of a title is the commonest
   thing anyone types here.

   The category is matched as a *prefix*, and only from two letters. Both
   halves of that are there to keep the feature from making search worse:

     · includes() on the category would mean "id" matches every game filed
       under Kids, which is not something anyone typing "id" was asking for.
       A prefix is how people actually name a category — "puz", "puzz",
       "puzzle" — and nothing else lands on one by accident.
     · One letter is a title-narrowing gesture, not a category name, and a
       single "a" would otherwise pull in every Action and Arcade game and
       bury the titles actually starting to match. The floor is two.

   Worth knowing that the chip row below the box already filters by category,
   and does it better — it is exhaustive, it says what the categories are,
   and it composes with a search (visibleItems). This is the shortcut for
   somebody who types "word" without looking for the chip, not a replacement
   for it. */
